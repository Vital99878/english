  'Three bank robbers  got  а surprise last  night. This is what happened. The three robbers, who all work as cleaners at а hospital, drove up to the bank on Main Street. The three men, wearing masks over their faces, got out of the car and ran into the bank. Inside  the bank, they pointed guns at the customers and bank tellers. One of the men told all the customers to lie down on the floor. And then one of the other men said something like, "Quick, the money! Give me money!" So one of the tellers handed them some bags. After leaving the bank, the three men jumped into their van and drove off. One mile down the road, the robbers parked their van next to an ambulance they had parked before the robbery. They got into the ambulance and  drove off. They went straight to their hospital. After leaving the ambulance in the hospital parking lot, the three men went together into а small room. There, they opened the bags of money they had been given - and got avery unpleasant surprise! The bank teller had given the robbers special bags containing bright red  ink! The  red ink is released when the bag is opened, and it can\'t bе washed off. So suddenly, the men found themselves covered in red ink! As the men left the room and tried to leave the hospital, an emergency room doctor saw them and she thought,  "Oh God,  they\'re  all  covered in blood." So she tried to help them but they refused her help and ran off. The doctor realized something funny was going on and she called the police. The police caught the  robbers - guess where? Outside the  bank on Main Street.' +
