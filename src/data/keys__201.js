// 'Terrorism has been а global problem for airlines for decades. However, although security at airports has always been tight, the 9/11 attacks made it clear that new measures were necessary. As а result, many new security procedures have been put into place. А good rule is to plan ahead and prepare for the strictest security policies. Common sense and wise planning are the keys to а successful trip.' +

The high-tech buzzword in airport security today is biometrics.

Historically, natural factors such as volcanic eruptions, changes in the Earth\'s orbit, and the amount of energy released from the Sun have affected the Earth\'s climate. For over the  past 200 years, the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, and deforestation have caused the concentrations of "greenhouse gases" in our atmosphere. These gases prevent heat from escaping to space, causing the atmosphere to become warmer.
