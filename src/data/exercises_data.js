Their room was on the forty-fifth floor. ln the evening the friends went to the theatre and came back to the hotel very late. "I am very sorry," said the clerk of the hotel, "but the lifts do not work tonight. lf you don\'t want to walk up to your room, we shall make beds for you in the hall." "No, no," said one of the friends, "no, thank you. We don\'t want to sleep in the hall. We shall walk up to our room." Then he turned to his friends and said, "It is not easy to walk up to the  forty-fifth floor, but  we shall make it easier. On the way to the room I shall tell you some jokes; then you, Andy, will sing us some songs; then you, Peter, will tell us some interesting stories." So they began walking up to their room. Tom told them many jokes; Andy sang some songs. At last they came to the thirty-sixth floor. They  were  tired and decided to  have а  rest. "Well," said Tom, "now it is your turn, Peter. After all the jokes, I would lik·e to hear а sad story. Tell us а long and interesting story with а sad end." "The story which I am going to tell you," said Peter, "is sad enough. We  left  the  key to our room in the hall."',
